Length Scales for DSA Analysis

L_c (Capture Radius) - for tau_diff = L_c^2 / D_eff:
  Values: [1. 2. 5.] nm
  Physical meaning: Distance for solute capture by dislocation
  Scale: nanometers

L_t (Travel Distance) - for tau_wait = L_t / (rho_m * b * epsilon_dot):
  Values: [ 0.1  1.  10. ] um
  Physical meaning: Distance dislocation travels before pinning
  Scale: micrometers

CRITICAL: These are DIFFERENT length scales with different physical meanings!
